𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
2. Feature Engineering: Created new features such as 'Total Search' to gain deeper insights into customer behavior.
3. Visualization: Utilized various visualization techniques to explore gender distribution, order patterns, and correlation among features.
4. Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into three distinct clusters based on their search behavior and order history. Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Cluster Analysis: Analyzed each cluster to understand the characteristics and behaviors of customers, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

The project demonstrated the power of data-driven approaches in uncovering hidden patterns and trends within customer data. By segmenting customers effectively, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, enhance customer experience, and ultimately drive growth.
